Description: Considering an (n x m) data matrix X, this package is based on the method proposed 
             by Gower, Groener, and Velden (2010) <doi:10.1198/jcgs.2010.07134>, and 
             utilize the  resulting matrices from the extended version of the NIPALS decomposition 
             to determine n triangles whose areas are used  to  visually  estimate the elements of
             a specific column of X. After a 90-degree rotation of the sample points, the triangles
             are drawn regarding the following points: 1.the origin of the axes; 2.the sample points;
             3. the vector endpoint representing some variable.
